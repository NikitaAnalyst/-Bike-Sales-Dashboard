# -Bike-Sales-Dashboard
This dashboard presents a high-level overview of bicycle sales performance from 2016 to 2018. The total revenue generated during this period is $7.69 million, with a customer base of 1,445.

## Key insights include:
2017 was the highest revenue-generating year.
Trek is the leading brand, accounting for nearly 60% of total revenue.
Baldwin Bikes is the top-performing store.
Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes are the most popular categories, particularly in Baldwin.
Marcelene Bonner and Venita Daniel are the top-performing sales representatives.
The dashboard offers valuable insights into revenue distribution by year, brand, category, city, store, and salesperson, supporting data-driven decisions for sales strategy and growth.

## Why This Project Stands Out:
# End-to-End Sales Insight:
Provides a holistic view of bike sales performance across different dimensions like time, store, customer, city, category, and brand.
# Visually Engaging and Interactive:
The dashboard uses a clean layout with intuitive visual elements (bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines) and interactive filters to support user-driven exploration.
# Business-Driven Design:
Tailored for business stakeholders—store managers, sales analysts, and marketing teams—to uncover actionable insights and drive data-informed decisions.
# Strong Storytelling Through Data:
Key performance metrics such as revenue trends, customer segmentation, and brand performance are effectively communicated for better understanding.

# Key Highlights:
Total Revenue: $2.59 Million
Total Customers: 1,445
Top-Performing Brand: Trek with $1.58M (20.53% of total revenue)
